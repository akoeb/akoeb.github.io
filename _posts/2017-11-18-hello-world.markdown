Good news everyone...

I guess I am at a point now where I am starting to go public with some of the things I do. Even though I am still pretty sure that all this is of no interest to most of the world out there, maybe there are still some people who actually do find this useful. Anyway, over the course of my career, many times I encountered blog posts that helped my with some problem at hand, so maybe this way I can give something back to "the community" (what ever that means).

Probably I will write not very often, and what I write will  be in english most of the time. Please excuse weird formulations and blunt errors in my language, for English is not my mothers tongue, that is German, actually. So please do not hesitate to let me know of errors and give me hints for better phrasing, may that help to improve my English language skills.

Same is true for all the other stuff that I am writing, always happy to get positive and negative feedback and corrections.

So far to the introduction, enjoy reading!
